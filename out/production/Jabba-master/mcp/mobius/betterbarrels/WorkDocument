ENDER BARRELS
    + When an ender upgrade is added, the barrel should switch to a remote storage hosted by BSpaceStorageHandler (but only server side. Client side,
    storage should still be handled the old way since everything is already setup for that).
        - Add creation and storage request to BSpaceHandler.
        - Flag to specify that a barrel has a remote storage
        - Add the index of the remote storage in the barrel itself ?
        - Keep a list in the handler about what barrel access what storage (storage => barrel[])
    
    + When a barrel is tuned to another barrel, the managed storage should be changed as well.
    
    
    
    
    + Upgrade is added
    + Barrel request its new storage
    + StorageHandler get's a copy of the current storage from the barrel and add the barrel index & storage to its internal list.
